My first code in React.js. 
It is a simple task manager, but it involved complex development. 
Besides implementing several components in a single container, I used an API via "axios" to generate a JSON with the necessary tasks. 
Finally, this manager deletes tasks and opens task details in new tab, all at runtime.
